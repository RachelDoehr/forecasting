# Univariate Classical Models Out-of-Sample Forecasting

## A custom extension of the statsmodels Markov Autoregression package for OOS forecasting

**COMPARISON OF PERFORMANCE IN PREDICTING U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS IN 'NORMAL' AND 'SHOCK' TIME PERIODS**

> Builds on the Markov AR available in the latest statsmodels package available <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.regime_switching.markov_autoregression" target="_blank">here</a>

> Model comparison to basic Autoregression and Holt's Exponential Smoothing

> Mathematical approach continues the strategy used in statsmodels, e.g. Kim, Chang-Jin, and Charles R. Nelson. “State-Space Models with Regime Switching: Classical and Gibbs-Sampling Approaches with Applications”. MIT Press Books. The MIT Press.

- Most people will glance at your `README`, *maybe* star it, and leave
- Ergo, people should understand instantly what your project is about based on your repo

> Tips

- HAVE WHITE SPACE
- MAKE IT PRETTY
- GIFS ARE REALLY COOL

## Example (Optional)

```javascript
// code away!

let generateProject = project => {
  let code = [];
  for (let js = 0; js < project.length; js++) {
    code.push(js);
  }
};
```
